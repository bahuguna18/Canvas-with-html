# Canvas-with-html


In this file first we have to set the canvas size to acutall window size, which we will do in javascript file

for example: 

  var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
  
  canvas.width = window.innerWidth;

  canvas.height = window.innerHeight;




now we learn how to make cirlce and line using 
  1. beginPath()  // to make line
  2. lineTo()
  3. stroke
  4. c.arc() // for circle
